# Eyes On AI

## Project Description

Eyes On AI is an innovative web application that employs the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide a cutting-edge interactive user experience. This application is built upon a robust stack of technologies including React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, MongoDB for the database, and Google's PALM for advanced language understanding and generation.

The core of Eyes On AI lies in its ability to process both visual and auditory inputs. Through accessing the user's camera and microphone, the application is designed to identify objects in the video feed and transcribe spoken language into text. This data is then processed by the PALM model to generate intelligent, contextualized responses. These responses are converted into spoken language, creating a live and engaging conversational interface for the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following software is installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm (for the React front-end and the Node.js back-end)
- MongoDB (as the database)

## Usage

Once the servers are running successfully, access the Eyes On AI application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Limitations and Considerations

While the object recognition and voice-to-text libraries deployed in this project are highly advanced, their accuracy may vary, especially for specific or unique items and individuals. Additionally, while PALM can provide a wide range of responses, the model's knowledge is based on the data available up to its last training cut-off and might not have the latest information on all subjects.

The performance of Eyes On AI can be influenced by the user's hardware capabilities and network conditions. For the best user experience, a stable internet connection and a high-performance device are recommended.
